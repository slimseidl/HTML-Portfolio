<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Personal Life</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is John Seidl, and I am a web developer. I live in Iowa where I work as a process manager for a company that manufacturers pump trailers for the agriculture, fire, and oil industries. I am a husband and a father to a beautiful little girl. My wife and I also have a yellow lab named teeter. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects including coding, woodworking, or other miscellaneous tasks on my honey-do list. I also enjoy spending time with my family, playing and watching sports, and playing cards.</p>

<h2>Professional Life</h2>
<p>As stated above, I am a <strong>Process Manager</strong> for a manufacturer in Iowa. This entails the development and continuous improvement of processes throughout the plant including ERP software functionality, manufacturing processes, and best practices. A good portion of my job also includes data mining and analytics. I have a passion for utilizing data to drive strategic business decisions.</p>

<p>Before taking on a role as a Process Manager, I was a continuous improvement engineer for the same company. As the company grew, the need for a larger role in development and analytics materialized so I jumped at the opportunity. This new role opened a door to the world of analytics through relational databases, SQL, business intelligence tools and more. I started out knowing very little about analytics but taught myself through videos and online forums. The hunger for knowledge constantly increased and still does on a daily basis which opened up the possibility of seeking out professional training.</p>

<p>Fall 2023 was when I decided to go back to school. I enrolled at Western Governor's University in the Data Analytics B.S. degree program. I am currently taking courses through WGU with an estimated finish date of summer 2025. As part of the degree program, I've learned languages such as SQL, Python, and R, to name a few. I also dipped my toes into the waters of web development, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Additional resources were acquired through my enrollment at WGU, which includes a subscription to Udemy.</p>


<p>Through Udemy, I've had the chance to enroll in a coding bootcamp that's allowed me to obtain more skills relating to the web and software development world. I plan to finish out my Data Analytics B.S. while working on personal web development projects and building my <a href="./Portfolio">portfolio</a>. Stay tuned here for more.</p>
