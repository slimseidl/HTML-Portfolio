<h1>The Best Movies According to John</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Twister</h3>
<p>This is a classic. The weather phenomenon of tornadoes hits close to home for a guy from the Midwest.</p>
<h3>Step Brothers</h3>
<p>This is a bold take. Many people may disagree with the raunchy humor, but I could watch this movie over and over again.</p>
<h3>War Dogs</h3>
<p>I'm a sucker for films based on true stories. This film featuring Miles Teller & Jonah Hill keeps you on the edge of your seat.</p>
